// Important to note:
// localStorage utilises your browser's cookies functionality to indefinitely store data on your client.
// This is more often used for unique IDs that cannot be cracked that easily.

// sessionStorage only stores the information on your client until it is closed.
// This is used when temporary data is needed for that one instance only.
